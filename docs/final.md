#Overview: 
Our app is a social media app about Food Recipes. Users are able to make posts about recipes that they know or have made and share them on our web app. The main feature of the app is that users can get a random recipe based on the tags and cuisine they select. This can users decide what to eat or cook when they are having trouble picking food to eat. There are a lot of Recipe Websites out there, but there aren't many that are social media sites that allows users to get random meals based on tags and cuisine and allows them to save their favorites and shopping cart, which makes our app innovative.

#Authentication/Authorization: 
Users are authenticated through Passport js. 
To register a user needs to enter: 
``` 
username: String (Unique),
password: String
name: String
email: string
 ```

 To Login a user needs to enter:
 ```
 username: String, 
 password: String
 ```
 And if the credentials match that of the database they will be logged in.

 The user will need to be logged in to access any of the web app besides register and login. Which means that every route (besides login and register) will check if the user is logged in and redirect them to the login page if they are not.

 All users will have the same permissions and no user will have any special permissions.

# Conclusion: 
Our team has really enjoyed creating this web app throughout the semester, we have enjoyed working as a team together and really liked the project we created. We have learned a lot through implementing and designing this app. We learned a lot about creating our own api and how to design a larger scale api that makes it easy to call endpoints in the frontend. We also learned a lot about SQL through making this app, as we learned how relations work in SQL tables and wee learned SQL queries that allows us to read, update, create , and delete data from the database, we also lerned how to use joins in SQL. The biggest difficulty that we had with this projecct is integrating the front end and backend together. There were a lot of small parts in our application that we needed to integrate such as user likes, that took a while as we would get bugs and didn't know if it was a backend or frontend problem. Our team would have liked to know SQL queries before we began this project, as we had a lot of bugs from our SQL queries when we were setting up the database and also testing the database.
