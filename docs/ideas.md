## Innovative Idea:
Our idea for the application is to help users figure out what to eat. Figuring out
what to eat can be a challenge, especially due to indecisiveness because there's so 
many options for food. This application will help to fix this problem by giving users
a random dish that they can choose to make. Dietary restrictions and preferences will 
be taken into account, if a user chooses to do so. This application does not relate 
to an existing application, 
## Important Components:
Web Scraper - We need to think about an API, or something for data retrievel from a food database. By doing research, hopefully we can find a large data selection for food dishes, and parse them / display them as needed.
#
General Food Preferences - As developers, we need to think about a user friendly UI that can also be accessible for people that have other food preferences and dietary restrictions. This UI should be very simple, as the goal is to make choosing something to eat as fast as possible.
